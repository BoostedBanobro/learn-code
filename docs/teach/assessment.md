# Assessment

I personally think that the best way to test someone's programming skills is to
**give them a challenging problem and have them solve it with a program.** Of
course, the problem should be within their means of solving - that is, they
should know everything they need in order to code it. Any of the programs in the
`challenge` package of each unit should be sufficient for testing students'
skills.

However, there are other ways to check students' progress. I've created **Google
Form quizzes** that are linked in the
[Quizzes](/learn-code/learn/students#quizzes) section. Students taking them can
view the results immediately after submission, and for certain tricky questions
I've provided answer feedback to hopefully clear up any confusion. They should
take students no more than 5-10 minutes to complete.
