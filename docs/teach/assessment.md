# Assessment

## Learn by Doing

The best way to test someone's programming skills is to
**give them a challenging problem and have them solve it with a program.** Of
course, the problem should be within their means of solving - that is, they
should know everything they need in order to code it.

Any of the programs in the `practice` package of each unit should be sufficient
for testing students' skills. If you want to give them an extra hard problem,
look in `challenges`.

## Quizzes

However, there are other ways to check students' progress. A good way to make sure
students are familiar with the concepts and can understand code is with quizzes. 
**Google Form quizzes** that are linked in the
[Quizzes](/learn-code/learn/students#quizzes) section.

Students taking them can view the results immediately after submission, and for
certain tricky questions answer feedback is provided to clear up any confusion.
Quizzes should take students no more than 5-10 minutes to complete and are completely
anonymous.
