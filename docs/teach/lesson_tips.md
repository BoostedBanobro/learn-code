# Lesson Tips

If you're a teacher, here are some tips to keep in mind when using this code in
conjunction with your lessons:

-   **Live coding > just displaying code.** Live coding allows students to
    process what the code is actually doing and keeps them more engaged than
    reading code. Also, encourage students to code along with you - just make
    sure you're not going too fast that they can't think about what they're
    copying down.

-   **Slow down, check in.** If you find yourself lecturing for over 5 minutes,
    it's usually a good idea to stop, take a breather, and ask if anyone has any
    questions. Sometimes students will be shy or afraid to interrupt you, and
    it's important to let them know that you care about their understanding and
    will help them master these topics.

-   **Don't information overload.** Aim for lessons that are no more than 1
    hour, give or take. This allows people to process and better retain
    information. Past that, students may get bored or will struggle to
    comprehend everything. Quality over quantity!

-   **The best way to learn programming is to program.** Lecturing is fine (if
    you do it right), but ultimately what will make your students grasp these
    topics is applying their knowledge to real-life situations.
