## Other Useful Stuff

The following sections detail miscellaneous Git commands that you
may find useful at some point in your programming journey, but are not
immediately necessary for you to code in FTC.

At the bottom of each section is a link to the Atlassian tutorial
on how to use that command, which you may find useful since we are only
briefly touching on each command and its usage.
