## .gitignore

If you want Git to not track certain files or directories, you can store them in
a `.gitignore` file (a text file). All you have to do is make the file in the
root directory of your project (name it `.gitignore`) and add files and/or
directories to the text file. Make sure to commit the `.gitignore` file. From
now on, any file/directory on the gitignore will be ignored by Git, so if you
modify it, it will not show up.

**Note**: Any file that used to be tracked by Git will still remain in the
repository's remote. To remove a file from Git but keep it in your working
directory, see [`git rm`](/learn-code/learn/unit7/other-useful-stuff#git-rm).

**Note**: If you want to write comments on the `.gitignore` file, use a `#`.

For example, this is what the
[`.gitignore`]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/master/.gitignore) file
from the Learn Code repository looks like:

```bash
# Ignore .DS_Store files
*.DS_Store

# Ignore IntelliJ IDEA files
.idea/
HowToCode.iml

# Ignore metadata generated by Jekyll
_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
.jekyll-metadata

# Ignore folders generated by Bundler
.bundle/
vendor/
```

Notice that directories are signified with a `/`.

## Globs

You can also use globs to specify file patterns instead of specific file or
directory names. For example, `*.java` would ignore all files that have the
`.java` extension. To learn more about globs, see the Atlassian tutorial in
[Further Reading](#further-reading).

## When to use a .gitignore

You should use a `.gitignore` file to ignore things like personal configuration
files created by your IDE or Text Editor. For example,
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) often has workspace
settings stored in a JSON file and
[Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) stores configuration files in
the `.idea` directory of a project.

## Further Reading

You can read about the `.gitignore` file on the
[Atlassian tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore)
or
