# Units

Source code is divided by unit:

1. [Introduction to Java](/learn-code/learn/unit1)
2. [Selection and Boolean Logic](/learn-code/learn/unit2)
3. [Loops and 1D Arrays](/learn-code/learn/unit3)
4. [Methods and Multi-Dimensional Arrays](/learn-code/learn/unit4)
5. [Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism](/learn-code/learn/unit5)
6. [Abstract Classes, Interfaces, and Enumerated Types](/learn-code/learn/unit6)
7. [Exception Handling and Git](/learn-code/learn/unit7)
8. [FTC Control System, Sensors, and FTC SDK](/learn-code/learn/unit8)
9. [Roadrunner](/learn-code/learn/unit9)
10. [FTC Computer Vision](/learn-code/learn/unit10)
11. [Control Theory](/learn-code/learn/unit11)

Units 1-7 are **Java Coding** while Units 8-11 are **FTC-Specific Coding**.

## File Navigation

All source code can be found under `src/com/omegarobotics`.

All compiled class files can be found under `out/production/HowToCode`. <br>
**Note:** Class files may be outdated compared to the source code.

Generated Javadoc files can be found under `javadoc`. <br>
**Note:** Javadoc files may be outdated compared to the source code.

All code for this website can be found under `docs`.

## Unit Packages

Inside of each unit folder are 3 packages:

1. `challenges` - Challenge programs to solidify skills
2. `lessons` - Demonstration programs to teach concepts
3. `practice` - Warm-ups and practice programs

Related code inside of those 3 packages may also be organized into subpackages.
