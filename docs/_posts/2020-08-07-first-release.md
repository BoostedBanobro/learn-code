The publishing of [Unit 7](/learn-code/learn/unit7) marks our very first
release! (We also had a pre-release for Unit 1
[v0.1.1](https://github.com/omega9656/learn-code/releases/tag/v0.1.1).)

Since the school year (and thus FTC season) is starting soon, updates to this
website will probably come at a slower pace. Expect Units 8-11 to be released by
the end of the year!

Hopefully you find this website helpful for your Java/FTC/programming journey.
If you see any issues with the site or have any questions, please feel free to
message any 9656 member on the FTC Discord or contact us through any of
[these methods](/learn-code/about#contact).
