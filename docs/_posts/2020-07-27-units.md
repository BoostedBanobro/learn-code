Hey there, it's been a bit slow-going updating the website, but
we're making steady progress. Speaking of "we," I've gotten some
team members on 9656 to help out. Please welcome Ananya, Afra, and Amaan
to the Learn Code contributing team!

Together we've been working on adding more content to each of the units.
You may have also noticed that previously units were all in one page.
However, as we wrote more content, it became clear that having all of the
unit's content on one page would make it really long and unattractive to read,
so we decided to break units up into sections, each with their own pages.

Hopefully this decision will make it a lot more manageable to learn how to code!
