Modified Exercise 11.2 from Liang, Intro to Java (Comprehensive) 10th ed.

Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee.

A person has a name, address, phone number (long), and email address.
A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior) and and student ID number (long).
    Define the student ID number as a constant.
An employee has an office address, salary, employee ID number (long), and date hired (MyDate).
    Use and implement a custom MyDate class for the date hired. (See below)
    Define the employee ID number and date hired as a constant.
A faculty member has office hours and a department.
A staff member has a title.

Note: For addresses, just put the first line of a made-up address for brevity.

Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.

Design a class called MyDate with the following attributes: day, month, year
Override the toString method in MyDate to print the date in the following format: MM/DD/YYYY
(You don't need to add an extra zero if the month or day is 1 digit)

Note: All of the classes should implement constructors, getters, and setters where appropriate.
All fields should be private. Unless otherwise specified, choose the most appropriate data-type for each field.

Bonus points for Javadoc comments and for writing UML diagrams for each class.

Write a test program called TestCollegeRoles
that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and
invokes their toString() methods (print them).
